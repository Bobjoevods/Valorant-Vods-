      <description>Sigmanaut/Ergonaut Meeting: January 15, 2023 VOTING PARTICIPATION  Chris furthered the discussion from last week about EF members voting on proposals as well as the agreed upon sigcan/sigmanaut member voting. qx() volunteered to write a voting proposal that would not just cover this, but all large and influential groups that could come into the ecosystem. For example, broad language to allow sigmanauts to voting power as long as they adhere to the sigmanauts mission.</description>

      <description>Sigmanauts/Ergonauts Meeting: January 29, 2023 VOTING PROCEDURES  It has been brought up many times that voting randomly is difficult to keep track of and remember to take part in. Proposal to move voting to once a month. qx() will modify the voting system to work as follows: -All new vote submissions will immediately post to the vote channel so that they can be voted on at any point in time.</description>

      <description>Sigmanaut/Ergonaut Meeting: February 26, 2023
No voice recording/transcript due to privacy of contracts and discussions of details of sig voting on specific candidates as well as price negotiation methods - closed session, essentially. Brief summary below
 Discussed how vote weekend was going and that we had one candidate that was held for discussion (reminder that any candidate who has yes votes will pass, a no vote means that they will be voted on and discussed in the next sig meeting).</description>

      <description>Promotion from Sigmanaut Candidate (Sigcan) to Sigmanaut  Ask to be promoted and sponsored by a current Sigmanaut Current Sigmanauts notice that a Sigmanaut candidate is active in the ecosystem and working in concert with the values of the Sigmanaut Mission Statement. They then put it to vote. Applied for sigcan but are well-known in the community so they are sponsored by a Sigmanaut to turn that vote into a Sigmanaut vote instead of sigcan.</description>

      <description>Sigmanaut/Ergonaut Meeting: April 2, 2023:  Angie spoke about reviving and adding content to Medium. qx showed off his beast machine running a node and noted that once a new HD comes in he will convert it to be another explorer with hopefully a lot of capacity (recruiting Boris to make sure it&amp;rsquo;s tip top shape). Will announce via channels and twitter when it is live. Did a quick recap of sigmanauts voting week as well as a reminder to finish voting so qx could run the tally/results script that night (sunday) Angie has a list of needed corrections from the SEO guys, they are making them so search optimization will perform better.</description>

      <description>Sigmanaut/Ergonaut Meeting: April 23, 2023  Support the community and core projects. That means watching for events announced and try your best to attend them, or, testing protocols, or, joining betas. Example: Put up a small test loan on sigmafi so you know how it works. Join the sprint with ergo/zealy! Point is, we need to support eachother as we continue to build in this market! Each of us should do our best to know the ecosystem and its public facing tools.</description>
