The path to becoming a Sigmanaut generally involves being involved in the larger Ergo community. Most people are active in either Telegram or Discord, but you do not have to be involved in social media. The only real criteria is generally agreeing with the principles outlined in the [Ergo Manifesto](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-26-the-ergo-manifesto/). If you'd like to use your unique talents to promote a decentralized, open, secure platform for contractual money that can be used by anyone, we want to hear from you.

The first step is to fill out the [application](application), which we used to learn a little about you, your skills and availability. The Ergo ecosystem needs developers, artists, writers, graphic designers, marketers, forum moderators, tech support and others. The same kinds of skills useful in any organization or useful in helping the Ergo ecosystem grow. But, as with any organization, limits are imposed by our imagination and the number of people available to do the many things that need to be done. Any little bit helps. 

After we get an application, the current Sigmanauts discuss their interactions with you, take a look at your social media accounts (if you have them) and try to get a sense if you'd be a good member of the Sigmanaut community. The process is mostly designed to keep trolling and contention within the group to a minimum. We want create a positive community that is a good experience for everyone involved. If voted in, an applicant becomes a Sigmanaut Candidate.

Sigmanaut Candidates becomes a full Sigmanaut when one of the following occurs:

- You ask to be promoted and are sponsored by a current Sigmanaut
- Current Sigmanauts notice that a Sigmanaut candidate is active in the ecosystem and working in concert with the values of the [Sigmanaut Mission Statement](mission). They then put it to vote. 
- Applied to be a Sigmanaut but are well-known in the community. So, they are immediately sponsored by a Sigmanaut to turn that vote into a Sigmanaut vote instead of Sigmanaut Candidate. 

The Sigmanaut Candidate designation is designed to let people in and get involved in the Sigmanaut community. They then can decide (and vice versa) whether they want to be involved with it. There are many talented people, and the community offers opportunities to learn many new things. But, as with any community, it is not for everyone. 

We try to be open to anyone and have an environment that encourages a diversity of perspectives, rooted in mutual respect among individuals. If still interested and motivated to help grow Ergo as a Sigmanaut after some time in the community, they can become a full member of the Sigmanaut community.
