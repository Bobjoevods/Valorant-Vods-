Sigmanauts is a community that believes in a decentralized, open, permissionless and secure platform for contractual money can be an empowering and transformative force, both for individuals and society. However, technology can only be a catalyst for change. Real change comes from communities and individuals learning how to use technology to improve their lives and their relationships with one another. The Sigmanaut community both tries to create a community of users of the Ergo blockchain to explore how it can be of benefit, and they try to represent the interests of users in the larger Ergo ecosystem. We invite you to read the [Ergo Manifesto](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-04-26-the-ergo-manifesto/), and if you agree with the ideas presented, consider joining the Ergo's [Telegram](https://t.me/Ergo_Chats) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/RC8M4Bkgsy) servers and [applying](../application) to join us!
