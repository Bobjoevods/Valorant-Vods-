- Ask to be promoted and sponsored by a current Sigmanaut
- Current Sigmanauts notice that a Sigmanaut candidate is active in the ecosystem and working in concert with the values of the [Sigmanaut Mission Statement](). They then put it to vote. 
- Applied for sigcan but are well-known in the community so they are sponsored by a Sigmanaut to turn that vote into a Sigmanaut vote instead of sigcan. 

Sigcan role is to get them involved in the Sigmanaut community and or get them in the meetings. If still interested and motivated to help after some time here, move them up to Sigmanaut where they can create and vote on proposals as well as chair some of the future committees. 

There definitely is a hole when it comes to reviewing the current sigcan list and seeing who is still active and might want to move forward. It was something that initially some were looking at in the beginning, and it is something that needs to be worked on.
